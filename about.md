This blog is written by me, a guy from Norway. After graduating with a MSc in Computer Science, I decided to found an [indie game startup, Gribb Games](https://gribbgames.com), with some friends while working part-time as a web developer.

At the time of writing this, almost a year has passed since we started working on Gribb Games. I'm planning on doing posts about what has happened and what I've learned so far, but most importantly, this blog will follow me along the journey that lies ahead.

Thanks for reading, stay tuned!
