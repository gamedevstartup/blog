This blog is written by me, a guy from Norway. After graduating with a MSc in Computer Science, I decided to found an [indie game startup, Gribb Games](https://gribbgames.com), with some friends while working part-time as a web developer.

The thought of being able to earn a living on something I have created myself is what drives me. The crowded business sector of mobile games is arguably not the easiest way to make money, but developing games is for me the perfect combination of challenging technical problem solving and creativity. It is fun and feels meaningful.

There are several reasons why I'm doing this blog. First, it's a nice way of keeping a sort of personal log on what I'm doing. Second, it serves as a marketing experiment trying to get more attention to the games we make at Gribb Games. Third, since I'm planning on being open and honest about what we are doing, it can help other likeminded people learning from what we do wrong and what we do right.
